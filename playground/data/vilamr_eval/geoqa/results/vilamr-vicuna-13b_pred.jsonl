As shown in the diagram, extend AN and AM to intersect BC at points F and G, respectively. Since angle BNA = angle BNF = 90\u00b0, BN = BN, and angle NBA = angle NBF, we can conclude that triangle BMA is congruent to triangle BMF (by ASA). Therefore, AN = FN, AB = FB, AM = MG, and AC = GC. This means that MN is the median of triangle AGF. Thus, MN = 1/2 GF. Given that FB + GC = AB + AC and BC + GF = AB + AC, we can use the given information BC = 12 and AB + AC = 18 - BC = 18 to find that GF = 6.
