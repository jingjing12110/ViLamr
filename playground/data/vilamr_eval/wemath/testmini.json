Determining Direction: Common basic directions include east, west, south, and north, as well as intermediate directions such as southeast, southwest, northeast, and northwest. In mathematics, \"up\" usually represents north, \"down\" represents south, \"left\" represents west, and \"right\" represents east to indicate directions.\n2. Determining Angle: Angles are used to describe the relative position between objects or the deviation of an object from a standard direction. For example, \"30 degrees west of north\" describes a direction that is 30 degrees to the left of the north direction.\n3. Determining Distance: Distance refers to the straight-line length from one point to another. When describing a position, it is necessary to specify the distance along a certain direction from a reference point.\n4. Describing Position: To describe the position of an object, first determine a reference point, then describe the direction, angle, and distance from the reference point to the object based on its actual location. For example, \"The hospital is located 100 meters in the direction 30 degrees west of north from the library.\"",

        "domknowledge concept descriptionain": "Understanding and Representing Angles:\n1. Understanding angles from a static perspective: An angle is a figure formed by two rays originating from a single point.\n2. Understanding angles from a dynamic perspective: When a ray rotates around its vertex to another position, the figure formed by these two rays is called an angle. Two rays with a common endpoint form an angle, this common endpoint is called the vertex of the angle, and the two rays are called the sides of the angle.\n3. Since rays extend infinitely in one direction, the length of the sides of an angle is irrelevant to the size of the angle.\n4. The size of an angle can be measured and compared.\n5. Straight angle: A 180° angle. When the two sides of an angle are on the same line, the angle formed is called a straight angle. Specifically, when the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is on the extension line of the initial side OA in the opposite direction, it forms a straight angle.\n6. Right angle: A 90° angle. When the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is perpendicular to the initial side, it forms a right angle. Half of a straight angle is called a right angle.\n7. Acute angle: An angle greater than 0° and less than 90°. An angle smaller than a right angle is called an acute angle.\n8. Obtuse angle: An angle greater than 90° and less than 180°. An angle greater than a right angle and less than a straight angle is called an obtuse angle.\n9. Full angle: A 360° angle. When the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side coincides with the initial side, it forms a full angle.",

Understanding angles from a static perspective: An angle is a figure formed by two rays originating from a single point.\n2. Understanding angles from a dynamic perspective: When a ray rotates around its vertex to another position, the figure formed by these two rays is called an angle. Two rays with a common endpoint form an angle, this common endpoint is called the vertex of the angle, and the two rays are called the sides of the angle.\n3. Since rays extend infinitely in one direction, the length of the sides of an angle is irrelevant to the size of the angle.\n4. The size of an angle can be measured and compared.\n5. Straight angle: A 180° angle. When the two sides of an angle are on the same line, the angle formed is called a straight angle. Specifically, when the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is on the extension line of the initial side OA in the opposite direction, it forms a straight angle.\n6. Right angle: A 90° angle. When the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is perpendicular to the initial side, it forms a right angle. Half of a straight angle is called a right angle.\n7. Acute angle: An angle greater than 0° and less than 90°. An angle smaller than a right angle is called an acute angle.\n8. Obtuse angle: An angle greater than 90° and less than 180°. An angle greater than a right angle and less than a straight angle is called an obtuse angle.\n9. Full angle: A 360° angle.

Understanding angles from a static perspective: An angle is a figure formed by two rays originating from a single point.\n2. Understanding angles from a dynamic perspective: When a ray rotates around its vertex to another position, the figure formed by these two rays is called an angle. Two rays with a common endpoint form an angle, this common endpoint is called the vertex of the angle, and the two rays are called the sides of the angle.\n3. Since rays extend infinitely in one direction, the length of the sides of an angle is irrelevant to the size of the angle.\n4. The size of an angle can be measured and compared.\n5. Straight angle: A 180° angle. When the two sides of an angle are on the same line, the angle formed is called a straight angle. Specifically, when the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is on the extension line of the initial side OA in the opposite direction, it forms a straight angle.\n6. Right angle: A 90° angle. When the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is perpendicular to the initial side, it forms a right angle. Half of a straight angle is called a right angle.\n7. Acute angle: An angle greater than 0° and less than 90°. An angle smaller than a right angle is called an acute angle.\n8. Obtuse angle: An angle greater than 90° and less than 180°. An angle greater than a right angle and less than a straight angle is called an obtuse angle.\n9. Full angle: A 360° angle. When the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side coincides with the initial side, it forms a full angle.",

Determining Angle: Angles are used to describe the relative position between objects or the deviation of an object from a standard direction. For example, \"30 degrees west of north\" describes a direction that is 30 degrees to the left of the north direction.\n3. Determining Distance: Distance refers to the straight-line length from one point to another. When describing a position, it is necessary to specify the distance along a certain direction from a reference point.\n4. Describing Position: To describe the position of an object, first determine a reference point, then describe the direction, angle, and distance from the reference point to the object based on its actual location.

Determining Angle: Angles are used to describe the relative position between objects or the deviation of an object from a standard direction. For example, \"30 degrees west of north\" describes a direction that is 30 degrees to the left of the north direction.\n3. Determining Distance: Distance refers to the straight-line length from one point to another. When describing a position, it is necessary to specify the distance along a certain direction from a reference point.\n4. Describing Position: To describe the position of an object, first determine a reference point, then describe the direction, angle, and distance from the reference point to the object based on its actual location.

Definition of an Ordered Pair: An ordered pair is a combination of two numbers, typically used to represent the position of a point in a Cartesian coordinate system. The two numbers in the ordered pair represent values on different directions or axes.\n2. Composition of an Ordered Pair: In an ordered pair (x, y), the first number x represents the column number, which is the horizontal position; the second number y represents the row number, which is the vertical position. This notation follows the \"horizontal first, then vertical\" convention.\n3. Notation of an Ordered Pair: When using an ordered pair to represent a point's position, the numbers or letters representing the column and row need to be enclosed in parentheses, for example, (2, 5) represents the position at column 2, row 5.\n4. Uniqueness of an Ordered Pair: Each ordered pair uniquely determines a position, and conversely, a position can be uniquely represented by an ordered pair.",

Obtuse triangle: One of the three interior angles of the triangle is greater than 90 degrees.\n3. By side classification: Scalene triangle: A triangle where all three sides are of different lengths. Isosceles triangle: A triangle with two equal sides. Equilateral triangle: A triangle with all three sides equal.\n4. The sum of the interior angles of a triangle in a plane is 180 degrees.\n5. The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is greater than the length of the third side, and the difference between the lengths of any two sides is less than the length of the third side.\n6. The height of a triangle is the perpendicular line segment drawn from a vertex to the opposite side.\n7. To draw the height of a triangle: Choose one side as the base. Find the vertex opposite the base. Using a ruler and compass, draw a perpendicular line from the vertex to the base. Ensure to mark the right angle symbol, indicating it is the height.\n8. Once the lengths of the three sides of a triangle are determined, the triangle is fixed. The angles and the area enclosed by the three sides do not change.",

        "domknowledge concept descriptionain": "Describing Simple Routes Based on Direction and Distance:\n1. Determining Direction: Commonly used basic directions include east, west, south, and north, as well as intermediate directions such as southeast, southwest, northeast, and northwest. In teaching, the convention is to use \"up\" for north, \"down\" for south, \"left\" for west, and \"right\" for east to identify directions.\n2. Determining Angles: Angles are used to describe the relative position between objects or the deviation of an object from a standard direction. For example, \"30 degrees west by north\" describes a direction 30 degrees to the left of due north.\n3. Determining Distance: Distance refers to the straight-line length from one point to another. When describing a route, it is necessary to indicate how far to travel from the starting point along a certain direction.\n4. Describing Routes: To describe a simple route, first determine the starting position, then describe the direction, angle, and distance from the starting point to the destination based on the actual path taken. For example, \"Starting from the school, walk 50 meters east to the traffic light, then walk 100 meters in a direction 45 degrees south by east to reach the library.\"",

Tiling, or tessellation of a plane, refers to the process of covering a plane using one or more types of shapes that are identical in size and shape, without leaving any gaps or overlapping.\n2. Common shapes for tiling: square, rectangle, triangle, parallelogram, regular hexagon.\n3. The sum of the angles at each vertex point of the tiling must equal a full angle (360°). A plane can only be tiled if the sum of the angles at each vertex point equals a full angle.\n4. Since the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180°, using several congruent triangles, each angle can be used twice to form a full angle, so triangles can always tile a plane.\n5. The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is 360°, and at each vertex point of the tiling, the four angles just form a full angle, so any quadrilateral can tile a plane.\n6. Each interior angle of a regular hexagon is 120°, and they can also form a full angle, so regular hexagons can tile a plane.",

A plane can only be tiled if the sum of the angles at each vertex point equals a full angle.\n4. Since the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180°, using several congruent triangles, each angle can be used twice to form a full angle, so triangles can always tile a plane.\n5. The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is 360°, and at each vertex point of the tiling, the four angles just form a full angle, so any quadrilateral can tile a plane.\n6.

Then move horizontally according to the first number in the ordered pair, and move vertically according to the second number. The final position reached is the point represented by the ordered pair.\nUnderstanding and Representing Angles:\n1. Understanding angles from a static perspective: An angle is a figure formed by two rays originating from a single point.\n2. Understanding angles from a dynamic perspective: When a ray rotates around its vertex to another position, the figure formed by these two rays is called an angle. Two rays with a common endpoint form an angle, this common endpoint is called the vertex of the angle, and the two rays are called the sides of the angle.\n3. Since rays extend infinitely in one direction, the length of the sides of an angle is irrelevant to the size of the angle.\n4. The size of an angle can be measured and compared.\n5. Straight angle: A 180° angle. When the two sides of an angle are on the same line, the angle formed is called a straight angle. Specifically, when the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is on the extension line of the initial side OA in the opposite direction, it forms a straight angle.\n6. Right angle: A 90° angle. When the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is perpendicular to the initial side, it forms a right angle. Half of a straight angle is called a right angle.\n7. Acute angle: An angle greater than 0° and less than 90°. An angle smaller than a right angle is called an acute angle.\n8. Obtuse angle: An angle greater than 90° and less than 180°. An angle greater than a right angle and less than a straight angle is called an obtuse angle.\n9. Full angle: A 360° angle. When the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side coincides with the initial side, it forms a full angle.",

Determining Direction: Common basic directions include east, west, south, and north, as well as intermediate directions such as southeast, southwest, northeast, and northwest. In mathematics, \"up\" usually represents north, \"down\" represents south, \"left\" represents west, and \"right\" represents east to indicate directions.\n2. Determining Angle: Angles are used to describe the relative position between objects or the deviation of an object from a standard direction. For example, \"30 degrees west of north\" describes a direction that is 30 degrees to the left of the north direction.\n3. Determining Distance: Distance refers to the straight-line length from one point to another. When describing a position, it is necessary to specify the distance along a certain direction from a reference point.\n4. Describing Position: To describe the position of an object, first determine a reference point, then describe the direction, angle, and distance from the reference point to the object based on its actual location. For example, \"The hospital is located 100 meters in the direction 30 degrees west of north from the library.\"",

Understanding angles from a static perspective: An angle is a figure formed by two rays originating from a single point.\n2. Understanding angles from a dynamic perspective: When a ray rotates around its vertex to another position, the figure formed by these two rays is called an angle. Two rays with a common endpoint form an angle, this common endpoint is called the vertex of the angle, and the two rays are called the sides of the angle.\n3. Since rays extend infinitely in one direction, the length of the sides of an angle is irrelevant to the size of the angle.\n4. The size of an angle can be measured and compared.\n5. Straight angle: A 180° angle. When the two sides of an angle are on the same line, the angle formed is called a straight angle. Specifically, when the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is on the extension line of the initial side OA in the opposite direction, it forms a straight angle.\n6. Right angle: A 90° angle. When the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is perpendicular to the initial side, it forms a right angle. Half of a straight angle is called a right angle.\n7. Acute angle: An angle greater than 0° and less than 90°. An angle smaller than a right angle is called an acute angle.\n8. Obtuse angle: An angle greater than 90° and less than 180°. An angle greater than a right angle and less than a straight angle is called an obtuse angle.\n9. Full angle: A 360° angle.

Understanding angles from a static perspective: An angle is a figure formed by two rays originating from a single point.\n2. Understanding angles from a dynamic perspective: When a ray rotates around its vertex to another position, the figure formed by these two rays is called an angle. Two rays with a common endpoint form an angle, this common endpoint is called the vertex of the angle, and the two rays are called the sides of the angle.\n3. Since rays extend infinitely in one direction, the length of the sides of an angle is irrelevant to the size of the angle.\n4. The size of an angle can be measured and compared.\n5. Straight angle: A 180° angle. When the two sides of an angle are on the same line, the angle formed is called a straight angle. Specifically, when the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is on the extension line of the initial side OA in the opposite direction, it forms a straight angle.\n6. Right angle: A 90° angle. When the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is perpendicular to the initial side, it forms a right angle. Half of a straight angle is called a right angle.\n7. Acute angle: An angle greater than 0° and less than 90°. An angle smaller than a right angle is called an acute angle.\n8. Obtuse angle: An angle greater than 90° and less than 180°. An angle greater than a right angle and less than a straight angle is called an obtuse angle.\n9. Full angle: A 360° angle.

The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is greater than the length of the third side, and the difference between the lengths of any two sides is less than the length of the third side.\n6. The height of a triangle is the perpendicular line segment drawn from a vertex to the opposite side.\n7. To draw the height of a triangle: Choose one side as the base. Find the vertex opposite the base. Using a ruler and compass, draw a perpendicular line from the vertex to the base. Ensure to mark the right angle symbol, indicating it is the height.\n8.

This type of motion is called translation of the figure.\n2. Translation does not change the shape, size, or orientation of the figure.\n3. The shape and size of the figure remain unchanged after translation; only the position changes.\n4. After translation, the line segments connecting corresponding points are parallel (or collinear) and equal in length.\n5. Multiple consecutive translations are equivalent to a single translation.\n6. A figure after an even number of symmetries is equivalent to the figure after a translation.\n7. Translation is determined by direction and distance.\n8. After translation, corresponding line segments are parallel (or collinear) and equal in length, corresponding angles are equal, and the line segments connecting corresponding points are parallel (or collinear) and equal in length.\nArea of Parallelograms:\n1.

Definition of an Ordered Pair: An ordered pair is a combination of two numbers, typically used to represent the position of a point in a Cartesian coordinate system. The two numbers in the ordered pair represent values on different directions or axes.\n2. Composition of an Ordered Pair: In an ordered pair (x, y), the first number x represents the column number, which is the horizontal position; the second number y represents the row number, which is the vertical position. This notation follows the \"horizontal first, then vertical\" convention.\n3. Notation of an Ordered Pair: When using an ordered pair to represent a point's position, the numbers or letters representing the column and row need to be enclosed in parentheses, for example, (2, 5) represents the position at column 2, row 5.\n4. Uniqueness of an Ordered Pair: Each ordered pair uniquely determines a position, and conversely, a position can be uniquely represented by an ordered pair.",

A circle is an axisymmetric figure.\n3. The center of the circle is called the center, usually denoted by the letter O. A line segment connecting the center to any point on the circle is called the radius, usually denoted by the letter r.\n4. A line segment that passes through the center and has its endpoints on the circle is called the diameter, usually denoted by the letter d. The diameter is the longest line segment within the circle, and it is twice the length of the radius.\n5. All radii of a circle are equal in length, and all diameters are equal in length.\n6. Method of drawing a circle: Use a compass. The distance between the legs of the compass represents the radius. After setting the center and the radius, rotate the compass to draw a circle.\nProperties and Understanding of Cubes:\n1. A cube has six faces, all of which are squares.\n2.

A parallelogram is a closed shape in a plane formed by two pairs of parallel line segments.\n2. A quadrilateral with two pairs of opposite sides parallel is called a parallelogram.\n3. Rectangles, rhombuses, and squares are special types of parallelograms.\n4. In a parallelogram, both pairs of opposite sides are equal in length, both pairs of opposite angles are equal, adjacent angles are supplementary, the height (distance between the parallel lines) is the same everywhere, and the diagonals bisect each other.\n5. The height of a parallelogram is the perpendicular segment drawn from a point on one side to the opposite side, and this segment is called the height of the parallelogram.\n6. To draw a parallelogram, first draw two parallel and equal-length line segments, then connect the endpoints of these two segments to form a quadrilateral.",

Scalene right triangular ruler: One angle is 90°, and the other two angles are 30° and 60°.\nDetermining the Positions of Objects Based on Direction, Angle, and Distance:\n1. Determining Direction: Common basic directions include east, west, south, and north, as well as intermediate directions such as southeast, southwest, northeast, and northwest. In mathematics, \"up\" usually represents north, \"down\" represents south, \"left\" represents west, and \"right\" represents east to indicate directions.\n2. Determining Angle: Angles are used to describe the relative position between objects or the deviation of an object from a standard direction. For example, \"30 degrees west of north\" describes a direction that is 30 degrees to the left of the north direction.\n3. Determining Distance: Distance refers to the straight-line length from one point to another. When describing a position, it is necessary to specify the distance along a certain direction from a reference point.\n4. Describing Position: To describe the position of an object, first determine a reference point, then describe the direction, angle, and distance from the reference point to the object based on its actual location.

Scalene right triangular ruler: One angle is 90°, and the other two angles are 30° and 60°.\nProperties of Cones:\n1. The base of a cone is a circle, and the lateral surface of a cone is a curved surface.\n2. The distance from the apex of the cone to the center of the base is the height of the cone.\n3. When the lateral surface of a cone is unfolded, it forms a sector.\n4. The line segment from the apex of the cone to any point on the edge of the base is called the slant height of the cone, and all slant heights are equal in length.",

        "domknowledge concept descriptionain": "Understanding and Representing Angles:\n1. Understanding angles from a static perspective: An angle is a figure formed by two rays originating from a single point.\n2. Understanding angles from a dynamic perspective: When a ray rotates around its vertex to another position, the figure formed by these two rays is called an angle. Two rays with a common endpoint form an angle, this common endpoint is called the vertex of the angle, and the two rays are called the sides of the angle.\n3. Since rays extend infinitely in one direction, the length of the sides of an angle is irrelevant to the size of the angle.\n4. The size of an angle can be measured and compared.\n5. Straight angle: A 180° angle. When the two sides of an angle are on the same line, the angle formed is called a straight angle. Specifically, when the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is on the extension line of the initial side OA in the opposite direction, it forms a straight angle.\n6. Right angle: A 90° angle. When the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is perpendicular to the initial side, it forms a right angle. Half of a straight angle is called a right angle.\n7. Acute angle: An angle greater than 0° and less than 90°. An angle smaller than a right angle is called an acute angle.\n8. Obtuse angle: An angle greater than 90° and less than 180°. An angle greater than a right angle and less than a straight angle is called an obtuse angle.\n9. Full angle: A 360° angle. When the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side coincides with the initial side, it forms a full angle.\nRepresenting Positions Using Ordered Pairs:\n1. Definition of an Ordered Pair: An ordered pair is a combination of two numbers, typically used to represent the position of a point in a Cartesian coordinate system. The two numbers in the ordered pair represent values on different directions or axes.\n2. Composition of an Ordered Pair: In an ordered pair (x, y), the first number x represents the column number, which is the horizontal position; the second number y represents the row number, which is the vertical position. This notation follows the \"horizontal first, then vertical\" convention.\n3. Notation of an Ordered Pair: When using an ordered pair to represent a point's position, the numbers or letters representing the column and row need to be enclosed in parentheses, for example, (2, 5) represents the position at column 2, row 5.\n4. Uniqueness of an Ordered Pair: Each ordered pair uniquely determines a position, and conversely, a position can be uniquely represented by an ordered pair.",

        "domknowledge concept descriptionain": "Properties and Understanding of Triangles:\n1. A triangle is a closed geometric figure formed by three line segments connected end-to-end in sequence.\n2. By angle classification: Acute triangle: All three interior angles of the triangle are less than 90 degrees. Right triangle: One of the three interior angles of the triangle is exactly 90 degrees. Obtuse triangle: One of the three interior angles of the triangle is greater than 90 degrees.\n3. By side classification: Scalene triangle: A triangle where all three sides are of different lengths. Isosceles triangle: A triangle with two equal sides. Equilateral triangle: A triangle with all three sides equal.\n4. The sum of the interior angles of a triangle in a plane is 180 degrees.\n5. The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is greater than the length of the third side, and the difference between the lengths of any two sides is less than the length of the third side.\n6. The height of a triangle is the perpendicular line segment drawn from a vertex to the opposite side.\n7. To draw the height of a triangle: Choose one side as the base. Find the vertex opposite the base. Using a ruler and compass, draw a perpendicular line from the vertex to the base. Ensure to mark the right angle symbol, indicating it is the height.\n8. Once the lengths of the three sides of a triangle are determined, the triangle is fixed. The angles and the area enclosed by the three sides do not change.\nDetermining the Positions of Objects Based on Direction, Angle, and Distance:\n1. Determining Direction: Common basic directions include east, west, south, and north, as well as intermediate directions such as southeast, southwest, northeast, and northwest. In mathematics, \"up\" usually represents north, \"down\" represents south, \"left\" represents west, and \"right\" represents east to indicate directions.\n2. Determining Angle: Angles are used to describe the relative position between objects or the deviation of an object from a standard direction. For example, \"30 degrees west of north\" describes a direction that is 30 degrees to the left of the north direction.\n3. Determining Distance: Distance refers to the straight-line length from one point to another. When describing a position, it is necessary to specify the distance along a certain direction from a reference point.\n4. Describing Position: To describe the position of an object, first determine a reference point, then describe the direction, angle, and distance from the reference point to the object based on its actual location. For example, \"The hospital is located 100 meters in the direction 30 degrees west of north from the library.\"",

The two numbers in the ordered pair represent values on different directions or axes.\n2. Composition of an Ordered Pair: In an ordered pair (x, y), the first number x represents the column number, which is the horizontal position; the second number y represents the row number, which is the vertical position. This notation follows the \"horizontal first, then vertical\" convention.\n3. Notation of an Ordered Pair: When using an ordered pair to represent a point's position, the numbers or letters representing the column and row need to be enclosed in parentheses, for example, (2, 5) represents the position at column 2, row 5.\n4. Uniqueness of an Ordered Pair: Each ordered pair uniquely determines a position, and conversely, a position can be uniquely represented by an ordered pair.",

According to the exterior angle theorem, an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles.\nDetermining the Positions of Objects Based on Direction, Angle, and Distance:\n1. Determining Direction: Common basic directions include east, west, south, and north, as well as intermediate directions such as southeast, southwest, northeast, and northwest. In mathematics, \"up\" usually represents north, \"down\" represents south, \"left\" represents west, and \"right\" represents east to indicate directions.\n2.

For example, \"30 degrees west of north\" describes a direction that is 30 degrees to the left of the north direction.\n3. Determining Distance: Distance refers to the straight-line length from one point to another. When describing a position, it is necessary to specify the distance along a certain direction from a reference point.\n4.

Since the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180°, using several congruent triangles, each angle can be used twice to form a full angle, so triangles can always tile a plane.\n5. The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is 360°, and at each vertex point of the tiling, the four angles just form a full angle, so any quadrilateral can tile a plane.\n6. Each interior angle of a regular hexagon is 120°, and they can also form a full angle, so regular hexagons can tile a plane.",

Definition of an Ordered Pair: An ordered pair is a combination of two numbers, typically used to represent the position of a point in a Cartesian coordinate system. The two numbers in the ordered pair represent values on different directions or axes.\n2. Composition of an Ordered Pair: In an ordered pair (x, y), the first number x represents the column number, which is the horizontal position; the second number y represents the row number, which is the vertical position. This notation follows the \"horizontal first, then vertical\" convention.\n3. Notation of an Ordered Pair: When using an ordered pair to represent a point's position, the numbers or letters representing the column and row need to be enclosed in parentheses, for example, (2, 5) represents the position at column 2, row 5.\n4. Uniqueness of an Ordered Pair: Each ordered pair uniquely determines a position, and conversely, a position can be uniquely represented by an ordered pair.\nTranslation:\n1. Translation refers to the movement of all points of a figure in the same plane by the same distance in a given direction. This type of motion is called translation of the figure.\n2. Translation does not change the shape, size, or orientation of the figure.\n3. The shape and size of the figure remain unchanged after translation; only the position changes.\n4. After translation, the line segments connecting corresponding points are parallel (or collinear) and equal in length.\n5. Multiple consecutive translations are equivalent to a single translation.\n6. A figure after an even number of symmetries is equivalent to the figure after a translation.\n7. Translation is determined by direction and distance.\n8. After translation, corresponding line segments are parallel (or collinear) and equal in length, corresponding angles are equal, and the line segments connecting corresponding points are parallel (or collinear) and equal in length.",

Determining Direction: Common basic directions include east, west, south, and north, as well as intermediate directions such as southeast, southwest, northeast, and northwest. In mathematics, \"up\" usually represents north, \"down\" represents south, \"left\" represents west, and \"right\" represents east to indicate directions.\n2. Determining Angle: Angles are used to describe the relative position between objects or the deviation of an object from a standard direction. For example, \"30 degrees west of north\" describes a direction that is 30 degrees to the left of the north direction.\n3. Determining Distance: Distance refers to the straight-line length from one point to another. When describing a position, it is necessary to specify the distance along a certain direction from a reference point.\n4. Describing Position: To describe the position of an object, first determine a reference point, then describe the direction, angle, and distance from the reference point to the object based on its actual location. For example, \"The hospital is located 100 meters in the direction 30 degrees west of north from the library.\"",

The bases are two equal circular surfaces, referred to as the upper base and the lower base; the lateral surface is a curved surface that connects the upper and lower bases.\n3. Unfolded Lateral Surface of a Cylinder: When the lateral surface of a cylinder is unfolded, it forms a rectangle or a square. If the unfolded surface is a rectangle, its length is the circumference of the circular base, and its width is the height of the cylinder; if the unfolded surface is a square, it means the height of the cylinder is equal to the circumference of the circular base.\nCircumference of Circles:\n1. A line segment passing through the center of a circle with both endpoints on the circle is called the diameter, usually denoted by the letter d. A line segment connecting the center of the circle to any point on the circle is called the radius, usually denoted by the letter r.\n2. The circumference of a circle = diameter × pi (C = πd) or the circumference of a circle = 2 × radius × pi (C = 2πr).\n3. The circumference of a semicircle can be calculated using the formula C = πr + 2r.\n4. In the same circle or congruent circles, there are an infinite number of radii and an infinite number of diameters. All radii and diameters in the same circle are equal. The length of the diameter is twice the length of the radius, and the length of the radius is half the length of the diameter.",

The size of an angle is not related to the length of its two sides but to the amount they open. The wider the two sides open, the larger the angle; the narrower they open, the smaller the angle. Full angle > straight angle > obtuse angle > right angle > acute angle.",

Understanding angles from a static perspective: An angle is a figure formed by two rays originating from a single point.\n2. Understanding angles from a dynamic perspective: When a ray rotates around its vertex to another position, the figure formed by these two rays is called an angle. Two rays with a common endpoint form an angle, this common endpoint is called the vertex of the angle, and the two rays are called the sides of the angle.\n3. Since rays extend infinitely in one direction, the length of the sides of an angle is irrelevant to the size of the angle.\n4. The size of an angle can be measured and compared.\n5. Straight angle: A 180° angle. When the two sides of an angle are on the same line, the angle formed is called a straight angle. Specifically, when the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is on the extension line of the initial side OA in the opposite direction, it forms a straight angle.\n6. Right angle: A 90° angle. When the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is perpendicular to the initial side, it forms a right angle. Half of a straight angle is called a right angle.\n7. Acute angle: An angle greater than 0° and less than 90°. An angle smaller than a right angle is called an acute angle.\n8. Obtuse angle: An angle greater than 90° and less than 180°. An angle greater than a right angle and less than a straight angle is called an obtuse angle.\n9. Full angle: A 360° angle.

A triangle is a closed geometric figure formed by three line segments connected end-to-end in sequence.\n2. By angle classification: Acute triangle: All three interior angles of the triangle are less than 90 degrees. Right triangle: One of the three interior angles of the triangle is exactly 90 degrees. Obtuse triangle: One of the three interior angles of the triangle is greater than 90 degrees.\n3. By side classification: Scalene triangle: A triangle where all three sides are of different lengths. Isosceles triangle: A triangle with two equal sides. Equilateral triangle: A triangle with all three sides equal.\n4. The sum of the interior angles of a triangle in a plane is 180 degrees.\n5. The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is greater than the length of the third side, and the difference between the lengths of any two sides is less than the length of the third side.\n6. The height of a triangle is the perpendicular line segment drawn from a vertex to the opposite side.\n7. To draw the height of a triangle: Choose one side as the base. Find the vertex opposite the base. Using a ruler and compass, draw a perpendicular line from the vertex to the base. Ensure to mark the right angle symbol, indicating it is the height.\n8. Once the lengths of the three sides of a triangle are determined, the triangle is fixed. The angles and the area enclosed by the three sides do not change.",

Two rays with a common endpoint form an angle, this common endpoint is called the vertex of the angle, and the two rays are called the sides of the angle.\n3. Since rays extend infinitely in one direction, the length of the sides of an angle is irrelevant to the size of the angle.\n4. The size of an angle can be measured and compared.\n5. Straight angle: A 180° angle. When the two sides of an angle are on the same line, the angle formed is called a straight angle. Specifically, when the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is on the extension line of the initial side OA in the opposite direction, it forms a straight angle.\n6. Right angle: A 90° angle. When the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is perpendicular to the initial side, it forms a right angle. Half of a straight angle is called a right angle.\n7. Acute angle: An angle greater than 0° and less than 90°. An angle smaller than a right angle is called an acute angle.\n8. Obtuse angle: An angle greater than 90° and less than 180°. An angle greater than a right angle and less than a straight angle is called an obtuse angle.\n9. Full angle: A 360° angle.

Determining Direction: Commonly used basic directions include east, west, south, and north, as well as intermediate directions such as southeast, southwest, northeast, and northwest. In teaching, the convention is to use \"up\" for north, \"down\" for south, \"left\" for west, and \"right\" for east to identify directions.\n2. Determining Angles: Angles are used to describe the relative position between objects or the deviation of an object from a standard direction. For example, \"30 degrees west by north\" describes a direction 30 degrees to the left of due north.\n3. Determining Distance: Distance refers to the straight-line length from one point to another. When describing a route, it is necessary to indicate how far to travel from the starting point along a certain direction.\n4. Describing Routes: To describe a simple route, first determine the starting position, then describe the direction, angle, and distance from the starting point to the destination based on the actual path taken. For example, \"Starting from the school, walk 50 meters east to the traffic light, then walk 100 meters in a direction 45 degrees south by east to reach the library.\"",

        "domknowledge concept descriptionain": "Understanding and Representing Angles:\n1. Understanding angles from a static perspective: An angle is a figure formed by two rays originating from a single point.\n2. Understanding angles from a dynamic perspective: When a ray rotates around its vertex to another position, the figure formed by these two rays is called an angle. Two rays with a common endpoint form an angle, this common endpoint is called the vertex of the angle, and the two rays are called the sides of the angle.\n3. Since rays extend infinitely in one direction, the length of the sides of an angle is irrelevant to the size of the angle.\n4. The size of an angle can be measured and compared.\n5. Straight angle: A 180° angle. When the two sides of an angle are on the same line, the angle formed is called a straight angle. Specifically, when the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is on the extension line of the initial side OA in the opposite direction, it forms a straight angle.\n6.

        "domknowledge concept descriptionain": "Properties and Understanding of Parallelograms:\n1. A parallelogram is a closed shape in a plane formed by two pairs of parallel line segments.\n2. A quadrilateral with two pairs of opposite sides parallel is called a parallelogram.\n3. Rectangles, rhombuses, and squares are special types of parallelograms.\n4. In a parallelogram, both pairs of opposite sides are equal in length, both pairs of opposite angles are equal, adjacent angles are supplementary, the height (distance between the parallel lines) is the same everywhere, and the diagonals bisect each other.\n5. The height of a parallelogram is the perpendicular segment drawn from a point on one side to the opposite side, and this segment is called the height of the parallelogram.\n6. To draw a parallelogram, first draw two parallel and equal-length line segments, then connect the endpoints of these two segments to form a quadrilateral.\nUnderstanding Circles:\n1. In a plane, a circle is defined as the set of all points that are at a fixed distance from a fixed point.\n2. A circle is an axisymmetric figure.\n3. The center of the circle is called the center, usually denoted by the letter O. A line segment connecting the center to any point on the circle is called the radius, usually denoted by the letter r.\n4. A line segment that passes through the center and has its endpoints on the circle is called the diameter, usually denoted by the letter d. The diameter is the longest line segment within the circle, and it is twice the length of the radius.\n5. All radii of a circle are equal in length, and all diameters are equal in length.\n6. Method of drawing a circle: Use a compass. The distance between the legs of the compass represents the radius. After setting the center and the radius, rotate the compass to draw a circle.\nProperties and Understanding of Triangles:\n1. A triangle is a closed geometric figure formed by three line segments connected end-to-end in sequence.\n2. By angle classification: Acute triangle: All three interior angles of the triangle are less than 90 degrees. Right triangle: One of the three interior angles of the triangle is exactly 90 degrees. Obtuse triangle: One of the three interior angles of the triangle is greater than 90 degrees.\n3. By side classification: Scalene triangle: A triangle where all three sides are of different lengths. Isosceles triangle: A triangle with two equal sides. Equilateral triangle: A triangle with all three sides equal.\n4. The sum of the interior angles of a triangle in a plane is 180 degrees.\n5. The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is greater than the length of the third side, and the difference between the lengths of any two sides is less than the length of the third side.\n6. The height of a triangle is the perpendicular line segment drawn from a vertex to the opposite side.\n7. To draw the height of a triangle: Choose one side as the base. Find the vertex opposite the base. Using a ruler and compass, draw a perpendicular line from the vertex to the base. Ensure to mark the right angle symbol, indicating it is the height.\n8. Once the lengths of the three sides of a triangle are determined, the triangle is fixed. The angles and the area enclosed by the three sides do not change.",

In a parallelogram, both pairs of opposite sides are equal in length, both pairs of opposite angles are equal, adjacent angles are supplementary, the height (distance between the parallel lines) is the same everywhere, and the diagonals bisect each other.\n5. The height of a parallelogram is the perpendicular segment drawn from a point on one side to the opposite side, and this segment is called the height of the parallelogram.\n6. To draw a parallelogram, first draw two parallel and equal-length line segments, then connect the endpoints of these two segments to form a quadrilateral.",

Formation of a Cylinder: A cylinder can be formed by rotating a rectangle around one of its edges, or by rolling a rectangle into a cylindrical shape.\n2. Components of a Cylinder: A cylinder consists of bases and a lateral surface.

Unfolded Lateral Surface of a Cylinder: When the lateral surface of a cylinder is unfolded, it forms a rectangle or a square. If the unfolded surface is a rectangle, its length is the circumference of the circular base, and its width is the height of the cylinder; if the unfolded surface is a square, it means the height of the cylinder is equal to the circumference of the circular base.\nArea of Circles:\n1.

If a point on one line intersects another line forming a right angle, then this line is perpendicular to the other line.\n2. A line is perpendicular to another line if the angle between them is 90 degrees. Similarly, a line is perpendicular to a plane if it forms a 90-degree angle with any line lying in that plane.\n3.

From a given point on a line and a point not on the line, only one perpendicular line can be drawn to the given line.\nProperties and Understanding of Trapezoids:\n1. A trapezoid (or trapezium) is a quadrilateral with only one pair of opposite sides parallel. The parallel sides are called the bases of the trapezoid: the longer base is called the lower base, and the shorter base is called the upper base; the other two sides are called the legs; the perpendicular segment between the two bases is called the height of the trapezoid.\n2.

        "domknowledge concept descriptionain": "Observing Objects:\n1. When observing an object from different angles, you will see two or three adjacent faces, and the shape observed on each face is different.\n2. The top, front, and side faces of a rectangular cubiod or cube are defined by convention. The face facing upward is called the top face, the face facing the observer is called the front face, and the two side faces are called the side faces. It is impossible to see opposite faces of a rectangular cubiod or cube at the same time.\n3. When observing a combination of objects, not only should the shape of each object be considered, but also the positional relationships between the objects. If an object is blocked by another object, the blocked part will be difficult to observe.\n4. No matter which face a cube or sphere is observed from, the shape seen is always the same.\nVolume and Capacity of Rectangular Cuboids:\n1. The formula for calculating the volume of a rectangular cubiod: The volume of a rectangular cubed = length × width × height.\n2. In terms of letters: If V represents the volume of the rectangular cubiod, and a, b, h represent the length, width, and height of the rectangular cubed respectively, then the formula for the volume of the rectangular cubed can be written as: V = abh.\n3. The volume of a rectangular cubiod is equal to the base area multiplied by the height.\n4. The capacity of a rectangular cubiod usually refers to the amount of space a rectangular container can hold. In the absence of special instructions, capacity and volume can be considered the same concept, using the same units and calculation methods.\nConversion Rates and Calculations Between Volume Units (Including Liters and Milliliters):\n1. Conversion rates between volume units: 1 cubic meter (m³) = 1000 cubic decimeters (dm³); 1 cubic decimeter (dm³) = 1000 cubic centimeters (cm³); 1 cubic decimeter (dm³) = 1 liter (L); 1 cubic centimeter (cm³) = 1 milliliter (mL)\n2. Converting between Different Units: To convert from a larger unit to a smaller unit, multiply by the conversion rate. To convert from a smaller unit to a larger unit, divide by the conversion rate.\n3. To convert cubic meters to cubic decimeters: multiply by 1000.\n4. To convert cubic decimeters to cubic centimeters: multiply by 1000.\n5. To convert cubic decimeters to liters: 1 cubic decimeter equals 1 liter.\n6. To convert cubic centimeters to milliliters: 1 cubic centimeter equals 1 milliliter.\n7. To convert milliliters to cubic centimeters: 1 milliliter equals 1 cubic centimeter.\n8. To convert liters to cubic decimeters: 1 liter equals 1 cubic decimeter.\n9. To convert cubic decimeters to cubic meters: divide by 1000.\n10. To convert cubic centimeters to cubic decimeters: divide by 1000.\n11. To convert cubic decimeters to cubic meters: divide by 1000.",

The size of an angle is not related to the length of its two sides but to the amount they open. The wider the two sides open, the larger the angle; the narrower they open, the smaller the angle. Full angle > straight angle > obtuse angle > right angle > acute angle.\nFolding Problems of Figures:\n1. The folded figure exhibits the properties of a symmetrical figure, with the fold line as the axis of symmetry, and the two parts of the figure before and after folding are symmetrical about the fold line.\nUnderstanding and Representing Angles:\n1. Understanding angles from a static perspective: An angle is a figure formed by two rays originating from a single point.\n2. Understanding angles from a dynamic perspective: When a ray rotates around its vertex to another position, the figure formed by these two rays is called an angle. Two rays with a common endpoint form an angle, this common endpoint is called the vertex of the angle, and the two rays are called the sides of the angle.\n3. Since rays extend infinitely in one direction, the length of the sides of an angle is irrelevant to the size of the angle.\n4. The size of an angle can be measured and compared.\n5. Straight angle: A 180° angle. When the two sides of an angle are on the same line, the angle formed is called a straight angle. Specifically, when the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is on the extension line of the initial side OA in the opposite direction, it forms a straight angle.\n6. Right angle: A 90° angle. When the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is perpendicular to the initial side, it forms a right angle. Half of a straight angle is called a right angle.\n7. Acute angle: An angle greater than 0° and less than 90°. An angle smaller than a right angle is called an acute angle.\n8. Obtuse angle: An angle greater than 90° and less than 180°. An angle greater than a right angle and less than a straight angle is called an obtuse angle.\n9. Full angle: A 360° angle.

A line segment passing through the center of a circle with both endpoints on the circle is called the diameter, usually denoted by the letter d. A line segment connecting the center of the circle to any point on the circle is called the radius, usually denoted by the letter r.\n2. The circumference of a circle = diameter × pi (C = πd) or the circumference of a circle = 2 × radius × pi (C = 2πr).\n3. The circumference of a semicircle can be calculated using the formula C = πr + 2r.\n4. In the same circle or congruent circles, there are an infinite number of radii and an infinite number of diameters. All radii and diameters in the same circle are equal. The length of the diameter is twice the length of the radius, and the length of the radius is half the length of the diameter.\nUnderstanding Circles:\n1.

In terms of letters: If V represents the volume of the cube and a represents the side length of the cube, then the formula for the volume of the cube can be written as: V = a³.\n3. The volume of a cube is equal to the base area multiplied by the height.\n4. The capacity of a cube usually refers to the amount of space a cubic container can hold. In the absence of special instructions, capacity and volume can be considered the same concept, using the same units and calculation methods.\nObserving Objects:\n1. When observing an object from different angles, you will see two or three adjacent faces, and the shape observed on each face is different.\n2. The top, front, and side faces of a rectangular cubiod or cube are defined by convention. The face facing upward is called the top face, the face facing the observer is called the front face, and the two side faces are called the side faces. It is impossible to see opposite faces of a rectangular cubiod or cube at the same time.\n3. When observing a combination of objects, not only should the shape of each object be considered, but also the positional relationships between the objects. If an object is blocked by another object, the blocked part will be difficult to observe.\n4. No matter which face a cube or sphere is observed from, the shape seen is always the same.\nSurface Area of Rectangular Cuboids:\n1.

The parallel sides are called the bases of the trapezoid: the longer base is called the lower base, and the shorter base is called the upper base; the other two sides are called the legs; the perpendicular segment between the two bases is called the height of the trapezoid.\n2. A trapezoid with one leg perpendicular to the bases is called a right trapezoid.\n3. A trapezoid with both legs equal in length is called an isosceles trapezoid.\n4. The height of a trapezoid is the distance between the upper base and the lower base.\nTessellation of Figures:\n1. Tiling, or tessellation of a plane, refers to the process of covering a plane using one or more types of shapes that are identical in size and shape, without leaving any gaps or overlapping.\n2. Common shapes for tiling: square, rectangle, triangle, parallelogram, regular hexagon.\n3. The sum of the angles at each vertex point of the tiling must equal a full angle (360°). A plane can only be tiled if the sum of the angles at each vertex point equals a full angle.\n4. Since the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180°, using several congruent triangles, each angle can be used twice to form a full angle, so triangles can always tile a plane.\n5. The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is 360°, and at each vertex point of the tiling, the four angles just form a full angle, so any quadrilateral can tile a plane.\n6. Each interior angle of a regular hexagon is 120°, and they can also form a full angle, so regular hexagons can tile a plane.\nSum of Interior Angles of Other Polygons:\n1. The sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is 360°, and the sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is 540°.\n2. The sum of the interior angles of a polygon = 180° × (number of sides - 2).\n3. The sum of the interior angles of an n-sided polygon = (n - 2) × 180°.\n4. A polygon with all sides of equal length and all interior angles equal is called a regular polygon.",

Comparison of angles: The size of angles can be compared directly by their degrees. Straight angle > obtuse angle > right angle > acute angle.\nperpendicularity:\n1. Perpendicular lines intersect at right angles, and their intersection point is called the foot of the perpendicular. If a point on one line intersects another line forming a right angle, then this line is perpendicular to the other line.\n2.

In a plane, the length of the line segment with these two points as endpoints is the distance between the two points.\n3. If two lines are parallel, then the shortest distance between them is perpendicular to both lines.\nProperties and Understanding of Rectangles:\n1. A rectangle is a plane figure and a parallelogram with one right angle. A rectangle is also defined as a parallelogram with all four angles being right angles. A square is a special type of rectangle where all four sides are equal in length.\n2. Properties of a rectangle: The two diagonals are equal in length; the two diagonals bisect each other; both pairs of opposite sides are parallel; both pairs of opposite sides are equal in length; all four angles are right angles; there are two axes of symmetry; it is unstable (prone to deformation); the square of the length of a rectangle's diagonal is equal to the sum of the squares of its two sides; the quadrilateral formed by sequentially connecting the midpoints of a rectangle's sides is a rhombus.\nPerimeter of Triangles:\n1. The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of its three sides. Scalene triangle: C = a + b + c (where a, b, and c are the lengths of the three sides of the triangle).\n2. Isosceles triangle: C = 2a + b (where a is the length of the equal sides, and b is the length of the base).\n3. Equilateral triangle: C = 3a (where a is the length of any one side).",

        "domknowledge concept descriptionain": "Understanding Line Segments, Lines, and Rays:\n1. A line has no endpoints and can extend infinitely in both directions.\n2. A ray has one endpoint and can extend infinitely in one direction.\n3. A line segment has two endpoints, a fixed length, and can be measured.\n4. Among all the lines connecting two points, the line segment is the shortest.\nUnderstanding Triangular Rulers:\n1. A triangular ruler is a triangular-shaped tool commonly used for measuring angles, drawing straight lines, and performing geometric constructions.\n2. There are two types of triangular ruler: Isosceles right trianglular ruler: One angle is 90°, and the other two angles are 45° and 45°. Scalene right triangular ruler: One angle is 90°, and the other two angles are 30° and 60°.\nDescribing Simple Routes Based on Direction and Distance:\n1. Determining Direction: Commonly used basic directions include east, west, south, and north, as well as intermediate directions such as southeast, southwest, northeast, and northwest. In teaching, the convention is to use \"up\" for north, \"down\" for south, \"left\" for west, and \"right\" for east to identify directions.\n2. Determining Angles: Angles are used to describe the relative position between objects or the deviation of an object from a standard direction. For example, \"30 degrees west by north\" describes a direction 30 degrees to the left of due north.\n3. Determining Distance: Distance refers to the straight-line length from one point to another. When describing a route, it is necessary to indicate how far to travel from the starting point along a certain direction.\n4. Describing Routes: To describe a simple route, first determine the starting position, then describe the direction, angle, and distance from the starting point to the destination based on the actual path taken. For example, \"Starting from the school, walk 50 meters east to the traffic light, then walk 100 meters in a direction 45 degrees south by east to reach the library.\"",

        "domknowledge concept descriptionain": "Finding Positions Based on Ordered Pairs:\n1. Representation of an Ordered Pair: An ordered pair consists of two numbers, with the first number representing the position on the horizontal axis (column) and the second number representing the position on the vertical axis (row). For example, the ordered pair (2, 4) represents the position in column 2, row 4.\n2. Method of Determining Position: To find a position based on an ordered pair, first identify a reference point on the plane. Then move horizontally according to the first number in the ordered pair, and move vertically according to the second number. The final position reached is the point represented by the ordered pair.\nTranslation:\n1. Translation refers to the movement of all points of a figure in the same plane by the same distance in a given direction. This type of motion is called translation of the figure.\n2. Translation does not change the shape, size, or orientation of the figure.\n3. The shape and size of the figure remain unchanged after translation; only the position changes.\n4. After translation, the line segments connecting corresponding points are parallel (or collinear) and equal in length.\n5. Multiple consecutive translations are equivalent to a single translation.\n6. A figure after an even number of symmetries is equivalent to the figure after a translation.\n7. Translation is determined by direction and distance.\n8. After translation, corresponding line segments are parallel (or collinear) and equal in length, corresponding angles are equal, and the line segments connecting corresponding points are parallel (or collinear) and equal in length.\nDescribing Simple Routes Based on Direction and Distance:\n1. Determining Direction: Commonly used basic directions include east, west, south, and north, as well as intermediate directions such as southeast, southwest, northeast, and northwest. In teaching, the convention is to use \"up\" for north, \"down\" for south, \"left\" for west, and \"right\" for east to identify directions.\n2. Determining Angles: Angles are used to describe the relative position between objects or the deviation of an object from a standard direction. For example, \"30 degrees west by north\" describes a direction 30 degrees to the left of due north.\n3. Determining Distance: Distance refers to the straight-line length from one point to another. When describing a route, it is necessary to indicate how far to travel from the starting point along a certain direction.\n4. Describing Routes: To describe a simple route, first determine the starting position, then describe the direction, angle, and distance from the starting point to the destination based on the actual path taken. For example, \"Starting from the school, walk 50 meters east to the traffic light, then walk 100 meters in a direction 45 degrees south by east to reach the library.\"",

Opposite faces of the rectangular cubiod are equal, so the expanded view will have three pairs of equal rectangles.\nSurface Area of Rectangular Cuboids:\n1. Definition of Surface Area: The total area of the 6 faces of a rectangular cubiod or a cube is called its surface area.\n2. Surface area of a rectangular cubiod = length × width × 2 + length × height × 2 + width × height × 2.\n3. Surface area of a rectangular cubiod = (length × width + length × height + width × height) × 2.\n4. Surface Area of a Rectangular Cubiod: If the letters a, b, and h represent the length, width, and height of a rectangular cubiod respectively, and S represents the surface area of the rectangular cubiod, then S = 2ab + 2ah + 2bh or S = 2(ab + ah + bh).",

Representation of an Ordered Pair: An ordered pair consists of two numbers, with the first number representing the position on the horizontal axis (column) and the second number representing the position on the vertical axis (row). For example, the ordered pair (2, 4) represents the position in column 2, row 4.\n2. Method of Determining Position: To find a position based on an ordered pair, first identify a reference point on the plane. Then move horizontally according to the first number in the ordered pair, and move vertically according to the second number. The final position reached is the point represented by the ordered pair.\nDistance Between Two Points:\n1. The line segment between two points is the shortest distance between them.\n2. In a plane, the length of the line segment with these two points as endpoints is the distance between the two points.\n3. If two lines are parallel, then the shortest distance between them is perpendicular to both lines.\nDescribing Simple Routes Based on Direction and Distance:\n1. Determining Direction: Commonly used basic directions include east, west, south, and north, as well as intermediate directions such as southeast, southwest, northeast, and northwest. In teaching, the convention is to use \"up\" for north, \"down\" for south, \"left\" for west, and \"right\" for east to identify directions.\n2. Determining Angles: Angles are used to describe the relative position between objects or the deviation of an object from a standard direction. For example, \"30 degrees west by north\" describes a direction 30 degrees to the left of due north.\n3. Determining Distance: Distance refers to the straight-line length from one point to another. When describing a route, it is necessary to indicate how far to travel from the starting point along a certain direction.\n4. Describing Routes: To describe a simple route, first determine the starting position, then describe the direction, angle, and distance from the starting point to the destination based on the actual path taken. For example, \"Starting from the school, walk 50 meters east to the traffic light, then walk 100 meters in a direction 45 degrees south by east to reach the library.\"",

This formula indicates that the volume of a cone is one-third the volume of a cylinder with the same base and height.\n2. Relationship between height and volume: If the volume of a cone is known, the height of the cone can be calculated using the formula h = 3V/(πr²), where V is the volume of the cone and r is the radius of the base.\n3. Relationship between base area and volume: Similarly, if the volume of a cone is known, the base area of the cone can be calculated using the formula A = 3V/h, where V is the volume of the cone and h is the height.\n4.

A triangle is a closed geometric figure formed by three line segments connected end-to-end in sequence.\n2. By angle classification: Acute triangle: All three interior angles of the triangle are less than 90 degrees. Right triangle: One of the three interior angles of the triangle is exactly 90 degrees.

Determining Direction: Commonly used basic directions include east, west, south, and north, as well as intermediate directions such as southeast, southwest, northeast, and northwest. In teaching, the convention is to use \"up\" for north, \"down\" for south, \"left\" for west, and \"right\" for east to identify directions.\n2. Determining Angles: Angles are used to describe the relative position between objects or the deviation of an object from a standard direction. For example, \"30 degrees west by north\" describes a direction 30 degrees to the left of due north.\n3. Determining Distance: Distance refers to the straight-line length from one point to another. When describing a route, it is necessary to indicate how far to travel from the starting point along a certain direction.\n4. Describing Routes: To describe a simple route, first determine the starting position, then describe the direction, angle, and distance from the starting point to the destination based on the actual path taken. For example, \"Starting from the school, walk 50 meters east to the traffic light, then walk 100 meters in a direction 45 degrees south by east to reach the library.\"\nUnderstanding and Representing Angles:\n1. Understanding angles from a static perspective: An angle is a figure formed by two rays originating from a single point.\n2. Understanding angles from a dynamic perspective: When a ray rotates around its vertex to another position, the figure formed by these two rays is called an angle. Two rays with a common endpoint form an angle, this common endpoint is called the vertex of the angle, and the two rays are called the sides of the angle.\n3. Since rays extend infinitely in one direction, the length of the sides of an angle is irrelevant to the size of the angle.\n4. The size of an angle can be measured and compared.\n5. Straight angle: A 180° angle. When the two sides of an angle are on the same line, the angle formed is called a straight angle. Specifically, when the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is on the extension line of the initial side OA in the opposite direction, it forms a straight angle.\n6.

Definition of an Ordered Pair: An ordered pair is a combination of two numbers, typically used to represent the position of a point in a Cartesian coordinate system. The two numbers in the ordered pair represent values on different directions or axes.\n2. Composition of an Ordered Pair: In an ordered pair (x, y), the first number x represents the column number, which is the horizontal position; the second number y represents the row number, which is the vertical position. This notation follows the \"horizontal first, then vertical\" convention.\n3. Notation of an Ordered Pair: When using an ordered pair to represent a point's position, the numbers or letters representing the column and row need to be enclosed in parentheses, for example, (2, 5) represents the position at column 2, row 5.\n4.

        "domknowledge concept descriptionain": "Understanding and Representing Angles:\n1. Understanding angles from a static perspective: An angle is a figure formed by two rays originating from a single point.\n2. Understanding angles from a dynamic perspective: When a ray rotates around its vertex to another position, the figure formed by these two rays is called an angle. Two rays with a common endpoint form an angle, this common endpoint is called the vertex of the angle, and the two rays are called the sides of the angle.\n3. Since rays extend infinitely in one direction, the length of the sides of an angle is irrelevant to the size of the angle.\n4. The size of an angle can be measured and compared.\n5. Straight angle: A 180° angle. When the two sides of an angle are on the same line, the angle formed is called a straight angle. Specifically, when the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is on the extension line of the initial side OA in the opposite direction, it forms a straight angle.\n6. Right angle: A 90° angle. When the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side is perpendicular to the initial side, it forms a right angle. Half of a straight angle is called a right angle.\n7. Acute angle: An angle greater than 0° and less than 90°. An angle smaller than a right angle is called an acute angle.\n8. Obtuse angle: An angle greater than 90° and less than 180°. An angle greater than a right angle and less than a straight angle is called an obtuse angle.\n9. Full angle: A 360° angle. When the ray OA rotates around point O, and the terminal side coincides with the initial side, it forms a full angle.\nTranslation:\n1. Translation refers to the movement of all points of a figure in the same plane by the same distance in a given direction. This type of motion is called translation of the figure.\n2. Translation does not change the shape, size, or orientation of the figure.\n3. The shape and size of the figure remain unchanged after translation; only the position changes.\n4. After translation, the line segments connecting corresponding points are parallel (or collinear) and equal in length.\n5. Multiple consecutive translations are equivalent to a single translation.\n6. A figure after an even number of symmetries is equivalent to the figure after a translation.\n7. Translation is determined by direction and distance.\n8. After translation, corresponding line segments are parallel (or collinear) and equal in length, corresponding angles are equal, and the line segments connecting corresponding points are parallel (or collinear) and equal in length.\nRepresenting Positions Using Ordered Pairs:\n1. Definition of an Ordered Pair: An ordered pair is a combination of two numbers, typically used to represent the position of a point in a Cartesian coordinate system. The two numbers in the ordered pair represent values on different directions or axes.\n2. Composition of an Ordered Pair: In an ordered pair (x, y), the first number x represents the column number, which is the horizontal position; the second number y represents the row number, which is the vertical position. This notation follows the \"horizontal first, then vertical\" convention.\n3. Notation of an Ordered Pair: When using an ordered pair to represent a point's position, the numbers or letters representing the column and row need to be enclosed in parentheses, for example, (2, 5) represents the position at column 2, row 5.\n4. Uniqueness of an Ordered Pair: Each ordered pair uniquely determines a position, and conversely, a position can be uniquely represented by an ordered pair.",
