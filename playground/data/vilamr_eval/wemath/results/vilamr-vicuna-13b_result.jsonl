        "response": "To find the correct route from point O to point B, we can use the information provided about the map. The map shows that angle AOB is 90\u00b0, which means that OB is perpendicular to CD. Additionally, it is given that AB = 3000m and BC = 4000m.\n\nTo determine the correct route, we need to consider the direction of OB. Since OB is perpendicular to CD, we can conclude that angle AOB + angle BOD = 90\u00b0. Furthermore, since angle AOB = 90\u00b0, it follows that angle BOD = 90\u00b0.\n\nBased on this information, we can deduce that OD = OB = 3000m. Therefore, the correct route from point O to point B is to first walk 3000m northeast, and then walk 4000m east.\n\nHence, the answer to the question is option A.\n###\nANSWER: A",

        "response": "Let's denote the radius of the base of the cylinder as 'r'. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the hypotenuse of the right-angled triangle formed by the diameter and the radius. The length of the hypotenuse is \u221a(10^2 - r^2). Since the diameter is 10 cm, the radius is half of that, which is 5 cm. Therefore, the length of the hypotenuse is \u221a(10^2 - 5^2) = \u221a(100 - 25) = \u221a75 cm. Now, we can calculate the surface area of the iron ball using the formula for the surface area of a sphere, which is 0.5 * 2\u03c0 * r * \u221a(10^2 - 5^2). Substituting the values, we get 0.5 * 2\u03c0 * 5 * \u221a75 = 125.6 cm^2. Therefore, the volume of the iron ball is 125.6 liters. Therefore, the answer is D.\n###\nANSWER: D",

        "response": "Since quadrilateral ABCD is a rectangle, we know that angle B = angle C = 90\u00b0 and AB = DC. Since the area of rectangle ABCD is 20 cm\u00b2, we can conclude that BC = 20/2 = 10 cm. Let's assume that the radius of sector B is r. We can calculate the area of sector B using the formula: (1/2) \u00d7 10 \u00d7 2\u03c0r = 20\u03c0r/2 = 10\u03c0r.

        "response": "By utilizing the properties of a circle and the given information, we can determine the area of each resulting sector. After folding the paper, the resulting angles formed by the intersecting lines are 1/2 of the original angles. Thus, angle A = angle D = 1/2 * angle AOB, and angle B = angle C = 1/2 * angle COD. Consequently, angle A + angle B = 1/2 * angle AOB + 1/2 * angle COD = 1/2 * (angle AOB + angle COD). Since the sum of the angles around a point is 360\u00b0, we have angle AOB + angle COD = 360\u00b0/2 = 180\u00b0. Therefore, angle A + angle B = 1/2 * 180\u00b0 = 90\u00b0. This implies that the sum of the lengths of the resulting segments is 2\u03c0r, where r is the radius of the circle. Given that the sum of the lengths of the new edges is 32 cm more than the original circumference, we have 2\u03c0r = 32\u03c0 - 2\u03c0r. Solving this equation, we find that r = 16 cm. Thus, the area of each resulting sector is (1/2) * \u03c0 * 16^2 = 256\u03c0 cm\u00b2. Therefore, the answer is option C.\n###\nANSWER: C",

Line segment BD can be obtained by rotating line segment AB counterclockwise by 130\u00b0 around point B. Then point B is in the () direction from point D.\nA. 6m in the direction north by west 70\u00b0\nB. 6m in the direction north by west 60\u00b0\nC. 6m in the direction east by south 130\u00b0\nD. 4m in the direction east by south 100\u00b0\nE.

        "response": "After rotating point B counterclockwise by 130\u00b0 around point B, it can be concluded that angle ABD is 130\u00b0. Since AB is 6m, BD is equal to AB multiplied by the sine of 130\u00b0, which is equal to 6 multiplied by 0.577, resulting in 3.424m. Therefore, the answer is B.\n###\nANSWER: B",

        "response": "As shown in the figure, let's assume that the expanded view of the cube is folded along the line AC. The top point of the folded view is point D, and the folded side is side BC. Therefore, angle BAC is equal to angle DAC, which is 45\u00b0. In the right triangle ABC, angle ABC is 90\u00b0, and angle ACB is 45\u00b0. Therefore, angle BAC is 45\u00b0. When point D is on point B, angle BAD is 90\u00b0. Therefore, angle DAC is 45\u00b0. Therefore, angle B is 45\u00b0. Therefore, the answer is option D.\n###\nANSWER: D",
