                "response": "Let's denote the length of the rectangular cuboid as 'x' and the height as 'y'. Since the combined area of the two shaded faces is 200 square centimeters, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the length and height. The area of each shaded face is given by the product of the length and height, so 12 * y = 200. Simplifying this equation, we get 12y = 200. Solving for y, we find y = 200/12 = 16.67 cm. The volume of the rectangular cuboid is given by the formula x * y * z, where z is the length. Substituting the values, we have x * 16.67 * z = 200 * z. Simplifying further, we get x * 16.67 * z = 200 * z. Therefore, the volume of the rectangular cuboid is 200 * z. Hence, the answer is option A.\n###\nANSWER: A",

The lateral surface area of the cone is 0.5 × 2πr × l = πl, where l is the slant height. Since the slant height is equal to the height of the cone, which is 10 times the radius, l = 10r. Therefore, the lateral surface area is π(10r) = 10πr. Equating this to the volume of the trough, we have 10πr = V. Solving for V, we get V = 10πr. Therefore, the volume of the trough is 10πr.

                "response": "As shown in the figure, connect DD'. According to the given information, we have DC = 2AC = 2BC. Since quadrilateral ABCD is an isosceles trapezoid, we have DE perpendicular  BC. Also, angle DEC = angle DCE. Since triangle DEC rotates counterclockwise around point D by an angle of 120°, we have angle DCE = angle C'DE = 120°. Furthermore, DE = DC = 2AC. Therefore, angle DEC = angle C'DE = 120°, and angle DCE = angle C'DE = 120°. Thus, EC' = EC, and AC' = AC. Therefore, the perimeter of quadrilateral ABCD is equal to 2(AC + DC) = 2(2AC + 2BC) = 4AC + 4BC. Therefore, the answer is A.\n###\nANSWER: A",
