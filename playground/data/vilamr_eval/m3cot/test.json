Thus there must be exactly $1$ solution to one of the equations, and no solutions to the other equation.\nWe find the discriminants ($b^2-4ac$) of the equations, so for equation $(1)$ the discriminant is $(6-m)^2-4(1)(-b)=(6-m)^2+4b$.\nFor equation $(2)$ the discriminant is $(6-m)^2-4(1)(10-b)=(6-m)^2+4b-40$.\nOne of these equations must equal zero, and one must be less than zero.\nSince $-40<0$, adding $(6-m)^2+4b$ to both sides doesn't change the inequality and $(6-m)^2+4b-40<(6-m)^2+4b$, so the greater value must be equal to zero so that the lesser value is always less than zero.\nThus we have $(6-m)^2+4b=0$.\n\nWe are also given that the line $y=mx+b$ passes through the point $(1,6)$, so substituting $x=1$ and $y=6$ gives $6=(1)m+b$ or $m+b=6$.\nThis means that $6-m=b$, so we can substitute in the above equation: \n\\begin{align*}\n(6-m)^2+4b&=0\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n(b)^2+4b&=0\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\nb(b+4)&=0.\n\\end{align*}\n We are given that $b\\neq 0$, so the only solution is $b=-4$.\nWhen we plug this into the equation $m+b=6$, we find $m-4=6$ so $m=10$.\nThus the equation of the line is $y=mx+b$ or $\\boxed{y=10x-4}$.\nAccording to the picture, the four choices given in the text are:\n (A) $y=10x-4$, \n(B) $y=7x-4$, \n(C) $y=7x-8$, \n(D)$y=10x-9$\n\nThus, It seems like there's an error in all the provided choices given in the text.\nHence, the answer is choice (B) in the given text.",

        "rationale": "First, note that $(2n)!! = 2^n \\cdot n!$, and that $(2n)!! \\cdot (2n-1)!! = (2n)!$.\nWe can now take the fraction $\\dfrac{(2i-1)!!}{(2i)!!}$ and multiply both the numerator and the denominator by $(2i)!!$.\nWe get that this fraction is equal to $\\dfrac{(2i)!}{(2i)!!^2} = \\dfrac{(2i)!}{2^{2i}(i!)^2}$.\nNow we can recognize that $\\dfrac{(2i)!}{(i!)^2}$ is simply ${2i \\choose i}$, hence this fraction is $\\dfrac{{2i\\choose i}}{2^{2i}}$, and our sum turns into $S=\\sum_{i=1}^{2009} \\dfrac{{2i\\choose i}}{2^{2i}}$.\nLet $c = \\sum_{i=1}^{2009} {2i\\choose i} \\cdot 2^{2\\cdot 2009 - 2i}$.\nObviously $c$ is an integer, and $S$ can be written as $\\dfrac{c}{2^{2\\cdot 2009}}$.\nHence if $S$ is expressed as a fraction in lowest terms, its denominator will be of the form $2^a$ for some $a\\leq 2\\cdot 2009$.\nIn other words, we just showed that $b=1$.\nTo determine $a$, we need to determine the largest power of $2$ that divides $c$.\nLet $p(i)$ be the largest $x$ such that $2^x$ that divides $i$.\nWe can now return to the observation that $(2i)! = (2i)!! \\cdot (2i-1)!! = 2^i \\cdot i! \\cdot (2i-1)!!$.\nTogether with the obvious fact that $(2i-1)!!$ is odd, we get that $p((2i)!)=p(i!)+i$.\nIt immediately follows that $p\\left( {2i\\choose i} \\right) = p((2i)!) - 2p(i!) = i - p(i!)$, and hence $p\\left( {2i\\choose i} \\cdot 2^{2\\cdot 2009 - 2i} \\right) = 2\\cdot 2009 - i - p(i!)$.\nObviously, for $i\\in\\{1,2,\\dots,2009\\}$ the function $f(i)=2\\cdot 2009 - i - p(i!)$ is is a strictly decreasing function.\nTherefore $p(c) = p\\left( {2\\cdot 2009\\choose 2009} \\right) = 2009 - p(2009!)$.\nWe can now compute $p(2009!) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\left\\lfloor \\dfrac{2009}{2^k} \\right\\rfloor = 1004 + 502 + \\cdots + 3 + 1 = 2001$.\nHence $p(c)=2009-2001=8$.\nAnd thus we have $a=2\\cdot 2009 - p(c) = 4010$, and the answer is $\\dfrac{ab}{10} = \\dfrac{4010\\cdot 1}{10} = \\boxed{401}$.\nSelect the option that matches the picture:\n(A) $\\frac{4}{11}$\n(B) $17$\n(C) $401$\n(D) $294$\nSo option C in the image is the correct answer for each of them.\nSo the solution is choice (B) in the given text.",

Despite their size, giant tortoises do not expend much energy and often rest for up to sixteen hours a day.\n3. In situations where there is limited water availability, giant tortoises have been observed to sleep for extended periods of weeks.\n4. This extended sleep behavior aids in saving energy for the tortoises.\n5. Additionally, giant tortoises have the ability to sustain themselves for up to a year without food or water if necessary.\n6. Based on the image and the given options, we have the following choices:\n   - Option A in the image: \"when there is not much water\"\n   - Option B in the image: \"when the tortoise is growing quickly\"\n   - Option C in the image: \"when it is cold outside\"\n7.

        "rationale": "Step 1: Let's analyze how a sloth's fur functions as a protective mechanism. Consider the distinctive way in which a sloth's fur grows in comparison to most other animals. While most animals have fur that grows downward to aid in shedding water, sloths have fur that grows upward, even when they are hanging upside down. This unique growth pattern allows rainwater to easily run off the sloth's body, helping it dry faster. Additionally, the fur's texture contains grooves that collect algae, giving the sloth a greenish hue that helps it blend into its leafy surroundings. This natural camouflage, combined with the sloth's leisurely pace, makes it challenging for predators to detect these creatures.\nStep 2: Now, let's evaluate the options provided in the given context. Option B in the image states, \"A sloth's fur helps it hide from predators.\" This aligns perfectly with the information presented in the image, which describes how the sloth's fur coloration and its slow movement are key factors in its ability to blend in and avoid detection by predators.\nStep 3: In conclusion, option B is the correct answer based on the provided information.",

Continue using present tense for describing the actions taking place: \"We go over a few basic terms...\"\n5. Teach them various aspects of using the Internet: \"and I introduce them to different browsers.\"\n6. Revert back to past tense to indicate a completed action: \"I taught them where to find the URL for a website...\"\n7. Describe the coverage of different website navigation techniques using present tense: \"We cover different ways to navigate around a website...\"\n8.

Since the focus is on finding another animal with a similar adaptation, the first step is to carefully observe and analyze the option pictures.\n3. By comparing the characteristics of these two animals with the described adaptation of the blackbuck, it can be determined which animal possesses a similar mouth adaptation for consuming plant matter.\n4. Considering the given information, it is evident that the animal in Figure A has long jaws and flat teeth, indicating that its mouth is also adapted for consuming plant matter.\n5. On the other hand, the animal in Figure B has a large mouth and sharp teeth, suggesting that its mouth is not adapted for eating plant matter but rather for consuming other animals.\n6.

We are given that the a allele, which codes for a king coat, is recessive to the A allele, which codes for a spotted coat.\n\n3. To determine the number of boxes representing offspring with a king coat, we need to find the genotype that corresponds to a king coat. Since a king coat is the recessive allele's version of the coat pattern trait, offspring with a king coat must have the genotype aa.\n\n4. In the Punnett square, there are 0 boxes with the genotype aa. \n\n5. To determine the number of boxes representing offspring with a spotted coat, we need to find the genotype that corresponds to a spotted coat. Since a spotted coat is the dominant allele's version of the coat pattern trait, offspring with a spotted coat must have the genotype AA or Aa.\n\n6. In the Punnett square, all 4 boxes have the genotype AA or Aa.\n\n7. So, the expected ratio of offspring with a king coat to offspring with a spotted coat is 0:4.\n\n8.

On the contrary, if the density of an object is higher than that of water, it will sink.When an object's density is less than that of water, it will naturally rise to the surface. Conversely, if the object's density exceeds that of water, it will sink.\nStep 3: \n  - Judging from the visual representation, Object D's weight reaching 1518.81 kg and its volume at 7.41 m^3.\n  - Hence, Density for Object D = 1518.81 kg / 7.41 m^3 = 204.97 kg/m^3.\n  - Due to a 204.97 value below 1000, Object D won't descend to the water's depths.\nStep 4: \n  - According to the image, Object B's weight reaching 4012.21 kg and its volume at 6.08 m^3.\n  - Overall, To calculate the density for Object B, divide the weight of 4012.21 kg by the volume of 6.08 m^3, resulting in a value of 659.90 kg/m^3.\n  - With a 659.9 less than 1000, Object B is guaranteed to stay afloat and won't plummet to the bottom of the water.\nStep 5: \n  - According to the image, The weight of Object E is 6543.47 kg, the volume of  Object E is 6.92 m^3.\n  - So The density for Object E is approximately 6543.47 kg / 6.92 m^3 = 945.59 kg/m^3.\n  - With a 945.59 less than 1000, Object E is guaranteed to stay afloat and won't plummet to the bottom of the water.\nStep 6: Thus, none of them is destined to descend to the depths of the water.\nStep 7: Thus, the water will engulf 0 items, causing them to sink.\nStep 8: Accordingly, the correct choice is choice \"(B) 0\" in the text.",

Conversely, if the object's density exceeds that of water, it will sink.\nStep 3: \n  - Judging from the visual representation, Object B records a weight of 4986.6 kg and a volume of 3.55 m^3.\n  - Overall, For Object B, the density can be calculated as:\n    The density for Object B = 4986.60 kg / 3.55 m^3 = 1404.68 kg/m^3.\n  - Should Object B possess a 1404.68 greater than 1000, it will invariably submerge to the bottom of the water.\nStep 4: \n  - Judging from the visual representation, Object C records a weight of 1585.65 kg and a volume of 13.95 m^3.\n  - Overall, The density for Object C is approximately 1585.65 kg / 13.95 m^3 = 113.67 kg/m^3.\n  - The fact that Object C possesses a 113.67 of less than 1000 ensures it remains buoyant and won't sink in water.\nStep 5: \n  - In light of the image provided, Object D's weight reaching 4722.72 kg and its volume at 1.14 m^3.\n  - Therefore, To calculate the density for Object D, divide the weight of 4722.72 kg by the volume of 1.14 m^3, resulting in a value of 4142.74 kg/m^3.\n  - Since 4142.74 is greater than 1000, Object D will submerge to the water's depths.\nStep 6: Therefore, Object C will float gracefully on the water.\nStep 7: Thus, 1 items will drift atop the water's surface.\nStep 8: Accordingly, choice \"(D) 1\" in the text should be selected.",

The table's color being brown suggests a wooden material, commonly used for tables. The two stacked shapes above the table, one ivory and one pink, are likely representing the cake layers. The ivory color is a common choice for wedding cakes, symbolizing purity and simplicity, while pink might indicate a touch of romance and sweetness, often associated with weddings. The ruby color of the table's legs could be chosen for its richness and could be part of the event's color theme.\nConcluding from these inferences, the image is a stylized depiction of a two-tiered wedding cake on a wooden table with ruby-colored legs.",

Summers are characterized by high temperatures, while winters enjoy milder weather. During the winter season, the temperature doesn't drop below 15 degrees Celsius, yet it remains lower than the summer temperatures.\nStep 2: After that, it's essential to analyze the precipitation distribution presented in the figure for a year. In this region, summer witnesses increased precipitation, while winter encounters a reduction, but the distinction between dry and wet seasons is not readily apparent.\nStep 3: In light of our prior analysis, let's encapsulate the essential rules governing temperature and precipitation:\n  In this area, you can expect hot and rainy summers, while the winters tend to be mild and receive only light rainfall.\nStep 4: Accordingly, subtropical monsoon climate is the climate that corresponds to this.\nStep 5: Therefore, the answer is choice \"(E) subtropical monsoon climate\"",
